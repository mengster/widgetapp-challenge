# WidgetApp User Guide

## What's new

WidgetApp now features _Streaming_, which allows multiple users to work on the same Thing simultaneously. Streaming enables Things to support sessions from multiple clients at the same time. Every change from every user is propagated to all sessions, in real time.

Sessions are authenticated using the same methods supported by WidgetApp, so your team can start collaborating over Things right now!

**Note:** Using the Streaming feature adds server load to your WidgetApp instance. Your admin may terminate sessions that consume too much server resources.
